Problem 01
Daniel and Victor are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter). 

Data: 
1. Store Daniel and Victor's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula given above
3. Create a Boolean variable 'danHigherBMI' containing information about whether Daniel has a higher BMI than Victor
. 
Hypothesis: 
 Data 1: Daniel weights 88 kg and is 1.89 m tall. Victor weights 98 kg and is 2.95 m tall. 
 Data 2: Victor weights 85 kg and is 1.82 m tall. Daniel weights 89 kg and is 1.77 m tall

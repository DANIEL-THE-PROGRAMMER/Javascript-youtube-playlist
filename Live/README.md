## Client & Server
-Client is what you use to consume what you are using(Someone who specialises in HTML,CSS And Javascript is caled a Frontend web Dev)

## What is the Internet ?
-Interconnection between networks
-We can have a system that we can send requests and get responses
-We can make a requests from client

## Which devices make request to our server
-The code that runs on the server(You will be a backend web developer)
-And when you work on client side and server side you are know as a Full stack developer
-If you know the architecture of systems and efficiency
-The reason is solely for job demand

## What is fun about it ?
-You just need to learn one language to learn code both on server and client side

## The Golden Rule / Seperation of Concerns.
-HTML = Content/ Structure
-CSS = Style
-JS = Behaviour / Interaction

## Agenda
-Questions
* Why is our html,css separate

## HTML SYNTAX
-They are not really programming languages, they are markup languages(If i give html 2 + 2 i will never have 4 back that is why they are not markup langauges)

- <p class="Daniel"> Hello Daniel </p>
<p> is the opening tag </p> is closing
-Everything you have in content must be wrapped up in tags

 ## Questions
 -When i write HTML do i care how it looks ?

 -We can move from h1 to h3 based on importance of the content
 -Why don't i like pretags?
